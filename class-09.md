# Form Controls :
# Whenever you want to collect information from visitors you will need a form, which lives inside a < form> element.

### Information from a form is sent in name/value pairs.
### Each form control is given a name, and the text the user types in or the values of the options they select are sent to the server.

#### Table cells can have different borders and spacing in different browsers, but there are properties you can use to control them and make them more consistent. 

#### Forms are easier to use if the form controls are vertically aligned using CSS.
#### Forms benefit from styles that make them feel more interactive.

# Events :
When the user interacts with the HTML on a web page, there are three
steps involved in getting it to trigger some JavaScript code.
Together these steps are known as **event handling** :
1.  Select t he element
node(s) you want the
script to respond to. 
2. Indicate which event on
the selected node(s) will
trigger the response. 
3. State the code you want
to run when the event
occurs. 

- Event listeners are a more recent approach to handling events.
They can deal with more than one function at a time
but they are not supported in older browsers. 

- When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a
JavaScript function. When this function then changes
the web page in some way, it feels interactive because
it has responded to the user.

- You can use event delegation to monitor for events
that happen on all of the children of an element.

- The most commonly used events are W3C DOM
events, although there are others in the HTMLS
specification as well as browser-specific events .
