## HTML elements are used to describe the structure of the page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).

> HTML has six "levels" of
headings:
< h1 > is used for main headings
< h2> is used for subheadings
 , If there are further sections
under the subheadings then the
< h3> element is used, and so
on...

> Paragraphs
- < b >
By enclosing words in the tags
< b > and < /b> we can make
characters appear bold.
- < i>
By enclosing words in the tags
< i> and < /i> we can make
characters appear italic

- Superscript & Subscrip
< sup>
The < sup> element is used
to contain characters that
should be superscript 

- < sub>
The < sub> element is used to
contain characters that should
be subscript.

- Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a code view.



# They also provide semantic information :

# CSS :
> works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

> Different types of selectors allow you to target your
rules at different elements.

> Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties. For example, the font-family
property sets the choice of font, and the value arial
specifies Arial as the preferred typeface.

> CSS rules usually appear in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page.


# Basic JavaScript Instructions :
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
Statements should end with a semicolon. 

> Scripts contain very precise instructions. For example,
you might specify that a value must be remembered
before creating a calculation using that value. 

> Variables are used to temporarily store pieces of
information used in the script.

- Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one).
1.  NUMBERING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY
Each item in an array is
automatically given a number
called an index
2. ACCESSING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY
To retrieve the third item on the
list, the array name is specified
along with the index number in
square brackets. 
3. NUMBER OF ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY
Each array has a property called
length, which holds the number
of items in the array. 

> JavaScript distinguishes between numbers (0-9),
strings (text), and Boolean values (true or false). 

> Expressions evaluate into a single value .

# Decisions and Loops :
there are often several places in a script where decisions are made that determine which lines of code should be run next . flowcharts can help you plan for these occasions .

## There are two components to a decision :
1. An expression is evaluated , which returns a value 
2. A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation.
