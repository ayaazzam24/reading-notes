# How People Access the Web:
- Browsers :
People access websites using
software called a web browser.
Popular examples include
Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari,
Chrome, and Opera.

- Web Servers :
When you ask your browser for
a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special
computer known as a web
server which hosts the website .

- Screen readers
Screen readers are programs
that read out the contents of a
computer screen to a user. They
are commonly used by people
with visual impairments.

# How Websites Are Created :
All websites use **HTML** and **CSS**, but content
management systems, blogging software, and
e-commerce platforms often add a few more
technologies into the mix.

# HTML & CSS :
## CSS : **Cascading Style Sheet**enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages .
 
 > Presentation: How to control
things like the color of text, the
fonts you want to use and the
size of those fonts, how to add
background colors to pages (or
parts of a page), and how to add
background images.

 > Layout: How to control where
the different elements are
positioned on the screen .


## HTML : **HyperText Markup Language**  is used to create web pages.
 
> HTML pages are text documents.

> HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled
brackets) to give the information they surround special
meaning.

> Tags are often referred to as elements.

> Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes
the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes
the end.

> Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more
about the content of that element.

> Attributes require a name and a value.

> To learn HTML you need to know what tags are
available for you to use, what they do, and where they
can go .

> DOCTYPES tell browsers which version of HTML you
are using.

>  You can add comments to your code between the
<**!-- and --**> markers.

> The id and class attributes allow you to identify
particular elements.

> The <div> and <span> elements allow you to group
block-level and inline elements together.

> <iframes> cut windows into your web pages through
which other pages can be displayed.

> The <meta> tag allows you to supply all kinds of
information about your web page.

> Escape characters are used to include special
characters in your pages such as <, >, and Â©

> The new HTML5 elements indicate the purpose of
different parts of a web page and help to describe
its structure.

> The new elements provide clearer code (compared
with using multiple <div> elements).

> Older browsers that do not understand HTML5
elements need to be told which elements are
block-level elements.

> To make HTML5 elements work in Internet Explorer 8
(and older versions of IE), extra JavaScript is needed,
which is available free from Google.

PROCESS & Design
> It's important to understand who your target audience
is, why they would come to your site, what information
they want to find and when they are likely to return.

> Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.

> Wireframes allow you to organize the information that
will need to go on each page.

> Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps
visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

> You can differentiate between pieces of information
using size, color, and style.

> You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify
the information you present.

# The ABC OF Programming :
## what is a script and how do i create one ?
> A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
> Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
> Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
> To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 

## How do computers fit in with the world around them ?

> computers create models of the world using data .

> the models use objects to represent physical things .

> programmers can write code to say " when this event occurs run that code "

> web browsers use HTML markup to create a model of the web page .each element  creats it's own node (which is a kindof object).

> To make web pages interactive , you write code that uses the browser's model of the web page .


## HOW do i write a script for a web page :
> It is best to keep JavaScript code in its own JavaScript
file. JavaScript files are text files (like HTML pages and
CSS style sheets), but they have the . j s extension.

> The HTML < script > element is used in HTML pages
to tell the browser to load the JavaScript file (rather like
the < link > element can be used to load a CSS file).

> If you view the source code of the page in the browser,
the JavaScript will not have changed the HTML,
because the script works with the model of the web
page that the browser has created.

### example :

<! DOCTYPE html>

< html >

< head>

< title>Constr ucti ve & amp; Co.</ title>

< link rel ="stylesheet" href="css/cOl.css" />

< /head>

< body>

< hl>Constructive & amp; Co.< /hl>

< p>For all orders and inquiries please call < em>555-3344</ em> </ p>
= = < script src="j s/ add-content .j s ">< /script>

</ body>

</ html>
