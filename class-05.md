# Text
The font-size property enables
you to specify a size for the
font. There are several ways to
specify the size of a font. The
most common are:
- pixels :Pixels are commonly used because they allow web
designers very precise control
over how much space their text
takes up. The number of pixels is
followed by the letters px.
- percentages:
The default size of text in
browsers is 16px. So a size of
75% would be the equivalent of
12px, and 200% would be 32px.

> You can control the space between lines of text,
individual letters, and words. Text can also be aligned
to the left, right, center, or justified. It can also be
indented.

> You can use pseudo-classes to change the style of an
element when a user hovers over or clicks on text, or
when they have visited a link.
