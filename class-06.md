# The Document Object Model (DOM) 
specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML
page and how JavaScript can access and update the
contents of a web page while it is in the browser window. 

> The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules.

> The browser represents the page using a DOM tree.

> DOM trees have four types of nodes: document nodes,
element nodes, attribute nodes, and text nodes.

> You can select element nodes by their id or cl ass
attributes, by tag name, or using CSS selector syntax.

> Whenever a DOM query can return more than one
node, it will always return a Nadel i st.

> From an element node, you can access and update its
content using properties such as textContent and
i nnerHTML or using DOM manipulation techniques.

> An element node can contain multiple text nodes and
child elements that are siblings of each other.

> In older browsers, implementation of the DOM is
inconsistent (and is a popular reason for using jQuery).

> Browsers offer tools for viewing the DOM tree .
