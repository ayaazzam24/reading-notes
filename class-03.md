# There are three types of HTML lists: 
1. ordered lists : are lists where each item in the list is
numbered. (use numbers)
2. Unordered lists are lists that begin with a bullet point
(rather than characters that indicate order).
3. Definition lists are made up of a set of terms along with the
definitions for each of those terms .

# - Lists can be nested inside one another.


# Boxes :
## Controlling size of boxes :

Overflowing Content :
The overflow property tells the
browser what to do if the content
contained within a box is larger
than the box itself. It can have
one of two values:
1. hidden
This property simply hides any
extra content that does not fit in
the box.
2. scroll
This property adds a scrollbar to
the box so that users can scroll
to see the missing content.

## Every box has three available properties that can be adjusted to control its appearance:
1. Border : separates the edge of one box
from another.
2. Margin :  to create a
gap between the borders of two
adjacent boxes.
3. Padding : g is the space between
the border of a box and any
content contained within it.

## The values this property display can take are:
1. inline
This causes a block-level
element to act like an inline
element.
2. block
This causes an inline element to
act like a block-level element.
3. inline-block
This causes a block-level
element to flow like an inline
element, while retaining other
features of a block-level element.
4. none
This hides an element from the
page

## - CSS3 has introduced the ability to create image borders and rounded borders

# Basic JavaScript Instructions :
Values in an array are accessed as if they are in
a numbered list. It is important to know that the
numbering of this list starts at zero (not one). 
> NUMBERING ITEMS IN
AN ARRAY .
> ACCESSING ITEMS IN

> NUMBER OF ITEMS IN

# Descisions & loops :
> Conditional statements allow your code to make
decisions about what to do next.

> Comparison operators (===, ! ==, ==, ! =, <, >, <=, =>)
are used to compare two operands.

> Logical operators allow you to combine more than one
set of comparison operators.

> if ... else statements allow you to run one set of code
if a condition is true, and another if it is false.

> switch statements allow you to compare a value
against possible outcomes (and also provides a default
option if none match).

> Data types can be coerced from one type to another.

>  There are three types of loop: for, while, and
do ... while. Each repeats a set of statements.
