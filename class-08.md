# CSS Layout :
## Building Blocks :
CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box. 
> Block-level boxes start on a new line and act as the main building blocks
of any layout, while inline boxes flow between surrounding text .

##  positioning schemes that allow you to control
the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute
positioning. 


> < div> elements are often used as containing elements
to group together sections of a page.

> Browsers display pages in normal flow unless you
specify relative, absolute, or fixed positioning.
> The float property moves content to the left or right
of the page and can be used to create multi-column
layouts. (Floated items require a defined width.)
> Pages can be fixed width or liquid (stretchy) layouts.
> Designers keep pages within 960-1000 pixels wide,
and indicate what the site is about within the top 600
pixels (to demonstrate its relevance without scrolling).
> Grids help create professional and flexible designs.
> CSS Frameworks provide rules for common tasks.
> You can include multiple CSS files in one page.
