# Domain Modeling
Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
Here's some tips to follow when building your own domain models.

1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
2. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
3. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
4. Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
5. Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
6. Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.




# Basic Table Structure
< table>
The < table> element is used
to create a table .
< tr>
You indicate the start of each
row using the opening < tr> tag.
The td stands for
table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a
closing </ td> tag.

Inside each row there are a number of cells
represented by the < td> element (or < th> if it is a
header).There are three elements that help distinguish between the main content of the table and the first and last rows :
- < thead>
The headings of the table should
sit inside the < thead> element.
- < tbody>
The body should sit inside the
< tbody> element.
- < tfoot>
The footer belongs inside the
< tfoot> element.

# functions ,method ,and objects :

- Functions allow you to group a set of related
statements together that represent a single task. 
- Functions can take parameters (informatiorJ required
to do their job) and may return a value.
- An object is a series of variables and functions that
represent something from the world around you. 
- Arrays and objects can be used to create complex data
sets (and both can contain the other).
