# comparsion operators :
Comparison operators are usually used on numeric or date fields, but can also be used on text fields:
## evaluation connditions :
**you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be. the result will be a boolean :(true or false)**
1. ">" greater than
this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than the number on the right .

2. " >= " greater than or equal to
this operator checks if the number on the left is greater than or equal to the number on the right .

3. " < " less than 
this operator checks if the number on the left is less than the number on the right .

4. " <= " less than or equal to
this operator checks if the number on the left is less than or equal to the number on the right .

5. " == " is equal to
this operator compares two values (numbers ,strings ,or booleans ) to see if they are the same .

6. " != " is not equal to

7. " === " strict equal to 
this operator compares two values to check that both the data type and value are the same .

8. " !== " strict not equal to

## logical operators :

1. logical And **&&** 
this operator tests more than one condition .

2. logical Or **||**
this operator tests at least one condition .

3. logical Not **!** 
this operator takes a singel boolean value and inverts it .

## loops :
 a programming structure that repeats a sequence of instructions until a specific condition is met. Programmers use loops to cycle through values, add sums of numbers, repeat functions, and many other things .
Two of the most common types of loops are the **while loop** and the **for loop**
