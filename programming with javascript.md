# Summary
## Programming with JavaScript :

### what is javascript :
**Allows you to make web pages more interactive by accessing and modifying the content and markeup used in web page while is being viewed in the browser .**

#### 1. access content : 
**You can use JavaScript to select any element, attribute, or text from an HTML page. For example:**
- Select the text inside all of the <hl>
elements on a page.
- Select any elements that have a
c 1 ass attribute with a value of note .
- Find out what was entered into a
text input whose id attribute has a
value of email.

#### 2. MODIFY CONTENT 
**You can use JavaScript to add elements, attributes, and text to the page, or remove them. For example:**
- Add a paragraph of text after the
first <hl> element.
- Change the value of c 1 ass
attributes to trigger new CSS rules
for those elements.
- Change the size or position of an
<img> element .

#### 3. PROGRAM RULES :
**You can specify a set of steps for the browser to follow (like a recipe), which allows it to access or change the content of a page. For example:**
- A gallery script could check which
image a user clicked on and display
a larger version of that image.
- A mortgage calculator could collect
values from a form, perform a
ca lculation, and display repayments.
- An animation could check the
dimensions of the browser window
and move an image to the bottom
of the viewable area (also known as
the viewport) .

## what is a script and how do i create one ?
> A script is a series of instructions that the computer
can follow in order to achieve a goal.
> Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of
all the instructions.
> Computers approach tasks in a different way than
humans, so your instructions must let the computer
solve the task prggrammatically.
> To approach writing a script, break down your goal into
a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task (a flowchart can help). 


# Expression :

 An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
### 1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE .

> Example : 
> ## var color = 'beige'; 
> The value of co 1 or is now beige


### 2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE.

> Example : 
> ## **var area = 3 * 2;**             
> The value of area is now 6. 

# OPERATORS :
Expressions rely on things called **operators**; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values.

## 1.  ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS
Assign a value to a variable

>Example:
>color = 'beige';
>The value of co 1 or is now beige.

## 2.  ARITHMETIC OPERATORS
Perform basic math

>Example
>area = 3 * 2;
>The value of area is now 6

## 3.  STRING OPERATORS
Combine two strings

>Example 
>greeting= 'Hi 1 + 'Mol ly';
>The value of greeting is now Hi Molly

## 4.  COMPARISON OPERATORS
Compare two values and return true or fa 1 se

>Example
>buy = 3 > 5;
>The value of buy is fa 1 se
