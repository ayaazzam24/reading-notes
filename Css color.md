# Color not only brings your site to life, but also helps
## convey the mood and evokes reactions.

> # There are three ways to specify colors in CSS:
1. ### RGB values
  
  These express colors in terms of how much red, green and blue are used to make it up.               For example: rgb(100,100,90)

2. ### hex codes
 
 These are six-digit codes that represent the amount of red, green and blue in a color, preceded by a pound or hash # sign.                                                                                  For example: #ee3e80

3. ### color names.
 
 There are 147 predefined color names that are recognized by browsers.                                 For example: DarkCyan

> # It is important to ensure that there is enough contrast
### between any text and the background color (otherwise people will not be able to read your content) .

 
 > # CSS3 has introduced an extra value for RGB colors to indicate opacity. It is known as RGBA.
 ### **CSS3** : introduces an entirely new and intuitive way to specify colors using hue, saturation, and lightness values.
